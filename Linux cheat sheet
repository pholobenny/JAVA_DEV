Extracting .tar.gz files

1) If your tar file is compressed using a gzip compressor, use this command to uncompress it.

    $ tar xvzf file.tar.gz

Where,

x: This option tells tar to extract the files.

v: The “v” stands for “verbose.” This option will list all of the files one by one in the archive.

z: The z option is very important and tells the tar command to uncompress the file (gzip).

f: This options tells tar that you are going to give it a file name to work with.

A tarball is a group or archive of files that are bundled together using the tar command and have the .tar file extension.
